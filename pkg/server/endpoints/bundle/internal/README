Unfortunately the golang.org/x/crypto/acme/autocert caching strategy is not
compatible with storing keys separate from certificates and also requires
loading raw private keys, instead of simply requiring the cache return a 
signer. This precludes us from integrating the the server KeyManager plugin.

As such, we've forked golang.org/x/crypto/acme/autocert and made the pertintent
changes to caching.

To facilitate testing we've also forked
golang.org/x/crypto/acme/autocert/acmetest and made a few small modifications
to trigger the terms-of-service prompt.

The version forked is from:
	golang.org/x/crypto v0.0.0-20190701094942-4def268fd1a4
